# a blog for me.
## but instead of me, it's you.

Before I kick this blog party off, I wanted to introduce myself. Here's a brief look into my ever-evolving formative years.

"I like the band, Bush. I'm going to make a `<FONT COLOR=red>webpage</FONT>` about it!" - 11.

"Xbox!! Video games!! Website about it!!!" - 15.

"Alright, let's try screenwriting." - 18.

"What is this YouTube thingâ€¦ I'm going to put up some videos of me playing guitar and see what happens." - 20.

"Nope. Websites." - 25.

The common thread between all of these interests is staying behind the keyboard. Thanks to the internet, I can [attempt to] affect the flow of a complete stranger's life for a $40/month connection fee. That's the powerful thought I've been chasing since I was 11.

Changing lives is not a subject I'm going to pretend to be qualified in. With this blog, I won't try to teach you anything in a "first-now-finally" way. Instead, I'll speak to you like I'd speak to myself of the past, if I had the chance. I'll tell me and you the important things I've learned from the life and career I'm still working on.

Stephen Sawchuk.

^ That's me.
