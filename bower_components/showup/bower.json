Break, fix, repeat.*\n\n[![Sample](http://s23.postimg.org/4wbfxk0ff/angular_showup_sample.png)](http://stephenplusplus.github.io/generator-weblog)\n\n\n## Demo\n[Click here](http://stephenplusplus.github.io/generator-weblog). Type \"angular\" to see the search in action.\n\n\n## About\nThis lil' plugin makes some decisions for you, so it's important you know what these are, should you want to make some overrides.\n\nFirst, here's what's expected and required for this to work:\n\n1. Showup will have full control of a \"container\" div.\n2. You keep a \"wordmap\" JSON file. (details below)\n3. You keep your posts as .md files in a single location.\n4. You like awesome things!\n\n\n#### The structure of your \"wordmap\"\n\n```js\n[\n  \"id:the-filename-of-your-post\",\n  \"every\",\n  \"word\",\n  \"from\",\n  \"your\",\n  \"post\",\n  \"id:the-filename-of-another-one-of-your-posts\",\n  \"every\",\n  \"word\",\n  \"from\",\n  \"this\",\n  \"post\",\n  \"too\"\n]\n```\n\n\n### API\n\n##### Showup.init\nBootstrap the plugin.\n\n```\n@ {\n  container\n    (DOM Element)\n  posts\n    ('path/to/posts/')\n  wordmap\n    ('path/to/wordmap/file.json')\n}\n```\n\n##### Showup.Load\nLoad a markdown file, process, and append to the container.\n\n```\n@ String\n  name of the file, without the '.md' extension\n```\n\n##### Showup.InsertPost\nTakes a block of markdown, processes it, and injects into the container.\n\n```\n@ String\n    block of markdown\n```\n",
